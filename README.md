# liri-node-app
LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.
-LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.
-when you input the song name the output should be the information about this song and links.
-when you input the artist name and band concert the output will show all information about that artist and the concert time and the last updates.
-when you input the movie name the output will be all the information about that movie.

-HERE IS SCREENSHOT OF THE OUTPUTS:
